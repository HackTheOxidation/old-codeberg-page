  <p>Greetings, Traveller!</p>
  <p>
    Welcome to HackTheOxidation's Codeberg pages, a peaceful place in the vastness of cyberspace.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a software engineering student and free/open-source software enthusiast among other things.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site is still under construction at the moment (seriously, when are you ever done with a software project?).<br>
    In the mean time, check out my projects:

  <h2>
    Skills/Interests
  </h2>

  <p>
  Most of the skills that I have acquired primarily come from University and (mostly) free-time hobby coding,<br/>
    but in spring of 2022 I got an internship working on a (quite large) python project, so now I also have real-world
    professional developer experience. Yay!
  </p>

  <h3>
    Operating Systems
  </h3>

  <ul>
    <li> Linux - I have tinkered with most of the main distros: Debian-/Ubuntu-based, Fedora/RHEL, Arch-based, Gentoo-based etc.
      <br>and some niche stuff: Artix, GNU Guix, Void Linux, etc. I am currently running Fedora as my main distro.
    </li>
    <li> BSD - I have also had my hands in some of the BSD-derivatives, mainly FreeBSD and OpenBSD.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>
    Programming Languages
  </h3>

  <ul>
    <li> Python - My first internship was all about python (django, specifically), which means that I have 6 months of "Professional" python development experience.<br>
      The code I wrote for the 'os2datascanner' project during my internship is fully open source! Check it out here: <a href="https://github.com/os2datascanner/os2datascanner">os2datascanner</a><br>
      Aside from that, I have used python in non-professional capacity as well,
      mostly in the form of small scripts and config files,<br>but now I am writing
      bindings for my moonalloy project: <a href="https://codeberg.org/HackTheOxidation/python-moonalloy">python-moonalloy</a>.<br/>
      In case your are familiar with the UniProt protein database, I wrote a CLI for fetching data: 
      <a href="https://codeberg.org/HackTheOxidation/uniprot-cli">uniprot-cli</a>.<br/>
      It also seems to be the language of choice for bioinformatics and I just started doing<br>
      problems on <a href="https://rosalind.info/users/ShadowSeer/">rosalind.info</a>
    </li>
    <li> C - I have around 1.5 years under my belt from hobby coding. I wrote a minimalist web-server for a project: <a
        href="https://codeberg.org/HackTheOxidation/ficus">ficus</a></li>
    <li> Rust - Around 6 months and it has quickly become one of my favorite programming languages.<br>
      I have written a small 'ls'-clone: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/neols">neols (crates.io)</a>.<br>
      I am also working on a numpy-like library written in rust with an API in Lua (still in early development):
      <a href="https://codeberg.org/HackTheOxidation/moonalloy">moonalloy</a>
    </li>
    <li> Go - I generally find Go to be a nice, minimalistic language. I have done some<br>
      tinkering with it and written (a very incomplete) cli-based http-client: <a href="https://codeberg.org/HackTheOxidation/twig">twig</a>.<br/>
      I also began working on how to extract text from a PDF at work.
    </li>
    <li> Haskell - This language is awesome! Being purely functional, it challenges the way you think and makes you a better programmer (I think).<br/>
      I wrote a few of the challenges from Advent of Code 2021 in haskell: <a href="https://codeberg.org/HackTheOxidation/advent-of-code2021">advent-of-code2021</a>.
    </li>
    <li> HTML, CSS - Used for making this retro, non-bloated website.</li>
    <li> Emacs Lisp - It's just cool and retro. I have contributed a few lines to <a href="https://github.com/Silex/docker.el">Silex/docker.el</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    And there are some more language, but I have an opinion about these:<br>
    JavaScript/TypeScript - I know enough to survive, but I don't really enjoy it...<br>
    C# - No. Just No...<br>
    Anything proprietary - Seriously, open source is the way to go.<br>
    C++ - Same level of experience as with C. I wrote a small JSON-parser from scratch: 
    <a href="https://codeberg.org/HackTheOxidation/picoJSON">picoJSON</a>.<br/>
    However, I don't find it particularly pleasant or fun to work with.<br/>
    Although I do acknowledge its capabilities.

  <h3>
    Text Editors, IDE's and Other Tools
  </h3>

  <ul>

      I still like vim and use it occasionally, so don't think I want to start a war.<br>
